# Clean Lines CMS - Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter

By [Eric Alain](https://ericalain.ca)

Leverages the power of Gatsby.js and Netlify headless CMS to segregate web logic from content creation, allowing content owners and web developers to collaborate on site management.

Based on a similar architecture to the [Kaldi Coffee starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/), but structured differently and leverages other technologies/plugins.

This template is simply meant to help users looking to implement a headless CMS site and is completely open source. Feel free to customize and make it your own. Enjoy!

## Cloudinary and Netlify CMS

This starter opts to integrate [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) as the primary method to serve images. Cloudinary is also [integrated into the Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/cloudinary/).

## Bootstrap

Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)/[React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) as the primary UI libraries.

## Font Awesome

Uses [Font Awesome](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) to serve icons.

## Performance

This template attempts to optimize performance by leveraging the following plugins.

- [PurgeCSS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/)
- [Brotli](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-brotli/)
- [Loadable Components SSR](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-loadable-components-ssr/)
